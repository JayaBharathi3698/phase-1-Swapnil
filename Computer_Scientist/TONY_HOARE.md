Charles Antony Richard Hoare FRS FREng[3] (born 11 January 1934)[4] is a British computer scientist. He developed the sorting algorithm quicksort in 1959â€“1960.[5] He also developed Hoare logic for verifying program correctness, and the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes (including the dining philosophers problem) and the inspiration for the programming language occam.
He was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2006 for fundamental contributions to computer science in the areas of algorithms, operating systems, and programming languages.

e implemented the language ALGOL 60 and began developing major algorithms.

He was involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi,which specified, maintains, and supports the languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.

He became the Professor of Computing Science at the Queen's University of Belfast in 1968, and in 1977 returned to Oxford as the Professor of Computing to lead the Programming Research Group in the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford), following the death of Christopher Strachey. He is now an Emeritus Professor there, and is also a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England.
