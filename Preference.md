# 2's complement is prefered over 1's complement. 
# Reason:-

No overflow :1's Compilment has no special usage for negative integers.2's Compliment  makes sense because it can be used in natural addition and subtraction arithmetic without any need to change the bits. Providing that no overflow occurs, the sign bit of the result is just the right value.

To represent the negative form of binary no. the system we use is 2'S complement.if one no. is binary then its -ve no. will be 2's complement of that no.so 2's complement can be used to perform arithmetic operations of both +ve and -ve numbers .While in 1's complement is not used for negative integers however it can be used with arithmetic operation of natural numbers so we prefer 2's complement over 1's complement.
