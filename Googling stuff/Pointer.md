# ü§ê Difference in initialisation of pointer.

Two ways of declaring a pointer are :- 
     
    i) int  *a;
    ii)int*  a;

According to some reviews on [STACKOVERFLOW](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3770187/difference-between-int-i-and-int-i) both way of initialisation will give the same result and it means a is the integer pointer type.

Some examples with their meaning are :- 

    i)  int* i,j;    :- i as an integer pointer and j as an integer.
    ii) int *i,j;    :- i as an int pointer and j as an int.



Both statement have same meaning .
