# Foobar 🐼

Foo or Foobar in Computer Science/ Programming is a commonly used name for variables and functions. It denotes that the concerned variable or function exists to demonstrate a particular concepts and has no specific identify.

History of foobar involving MIT and DEC in 1959 and its use in programming and other events like Google FooBar challenge.

Foobar is just a generic name used in examples .Is not really a meaningful function or something else .Is like calling :
doing_something(a)
you see often foo() .is just a example of your real application

FOO originated as a nonsense word with its earliest documented use in the 1930s comic Smokey Stover by Bill Holman. Holman states that he used the word due to having seen it on the bottom of a jade Chinese figurine in San Francisco Chinatown, purportedly signifying "good luck".If true, this is presumably related to the Chinese word fu ("福", sometimes transliterated foo, as in foo dog), which can mean happiness or blessing.

## History

Foo Bar has its roots to the word FUBAR from World War 2 which denotes that "things have gone out of control".

2 major organizations are behind the popularization of the terms namely Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The first seen use of the terms date back to 1964 from 3 major projects namely:

> * PDP-1 from Digital Equipment Corporation .
> * LISP by John McCarthy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) .
> * Project on Mathematics and Computation (Project MAC) .

PDP-1 was a computational hardware/ system developed by Digital Equipment Corporation in 1959 and was widely used at the time.

LISP is functional programming language and is considered the second oldest high level programming language which is in use even today.

Project on Mathematics and Computation was an effort in the 1960s led by MIT and funded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to create a time sharing computing device.

In fact, the 3 projects have shaped the computing systems we use today and have given us foo and bar as a practice used by them to make these major advancements.

Eg:-

     #include <stdio.h>

      int main() 
      {
         const char *foo = "Hello";
         const char *bar = "World!";
         printf(stdout, "%s %s\n", foo, bar);

         return 0;
      }
