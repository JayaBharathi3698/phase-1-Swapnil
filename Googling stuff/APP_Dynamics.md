**Data Collection** 📖

Data collection begins with AppDynamics Agents and the Controller. Agents are plug-ins or extensions sitting across your entire application ecosystem that monitor the performance of your application code, runtime, and behavior. The Controllers receive real time performance data from the agents, visualize your application performance, and send instructions to the agents.

**What are agents and the controller?** 🕴️

***AppDynamics agents*** are plug-ins or extensions that monitor the performance of your application code, runtime, and behavior. They’re  deployed to every corner of your application environment, from devices, to containers and hosts, to applications.


***The AppDynamics controller*** receives metrics from agents and sends them instructions. All of this performance activity is displayed via the Controller UI, which allows you to view data insights from multiple applications in one place.
