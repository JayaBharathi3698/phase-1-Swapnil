## Microprocessors

* Things that are associated with programming or programming is involved ,they are certain to have microprocessors.
* The development or creation of microprocessor changed the world.

**Generation of microprocessors**
* 8085
* 8086
* 80186
* 80286
* 80386
* 80486
* 80586
  * Pentium (P1,P2,P3,...,Core2Duo,Core i3, Core i5, Core i7).

Memory is only use dto store data or program, no matter what ,whether that data is song or movie it is stored in the form of number which is combination of hundered or thousand million of 0's or 1's.

Input-Output devices are printer , monitor , keyboard ,mouse ,joystick,etc.

Microprocessor is responsible for the conversiont of data or instructions to convert it from user understandable to computer understandable format and vice versa.

Pixels are the picture elements

Complier :- It is responsible for conversion of High Level Languag(HLL) to Low Level Language(LLL) or Machine Language(ML).

Eg:-
    
    a+c;

Assembler :- It is responsible for conversion os assembly language to LLL .

Eg:-
    
    add a,c;
   
   * Every instruction have its uniques operational code.

**3 Process of microprocessor**
* Fetch :- It means taking data/information from memory to microprocessor.
* Decode :- It means understanding the operational code and making sense form the operational code.
* Execution :- Getting output via printer or monitor.
    
Microprocessor works on hexadecimal system .
