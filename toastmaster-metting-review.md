The meeting was well organised by those group of people, some members were given specific tasks/roles to perform and monitor ,the performance of each individual speaker .

**Roles will be mentioned in other documentation**

This meeting majorly divided into three parts:-

i) Prepared speech session : in this speaker was supposed to speak and end his speech within 5-7 minutes.

ii) Table topic session : in this random topic was given to randon person and he/she is supposed to speak for about 1-2 minutes.

*additional event that was part of Table topic was Table turn code which was most interesting as in this ,speaker was supposed to speak on the topic for 2-3 min but the twist was, when host show her hand then speaker was supposed to speak negative of which he/she was speaking.*

iii) Evaluation session : Evaluators will evaluate and let the people know the positives, scopes of improvement, & some challenges within 2-3 minutes.

# At the meeting session :- 

At the beginning , the host intruduced to all the participants ,along with the role of each and every members which was way more different than those meetings that i have attended. The theme/topic of meeting was :- Life is a Pole of 50-50 chance, and slogan was :- shot in the dark meaning "a wild guess"
So our 1st speaker was none other than Ankit sir, it was quiet amazing to know more about his past days and the fact that he left his full time job and started teqaching as full time . 
The 2nd person was really good in expressing her self and using example of candle to demostrate the human state and using the molded wax of candle to make or convert it to a better product was remarkable. 
The thing that i liked about the 3rd person was that how she differentiated between teacher and a mentor, what a prodigy is and what a sutdent is.

Now moving towards table topic session , so our 1st topic was characteristics for which you would like to known for, the way that the person spoke without any preparation seems too professional, he choose to be fearless . For the 2nd contestant ,a song was played by host and then he/she was asked to speak what comes in his or her mind first.
Moving further we got Table tune code session which was a wild card entry of a new event and it was fun, because whlie speaking as the speaker catches the pace , they were forced to switch form for the motion to against the motion and vice-versa , it was fun too watch how speaker suffers to speak.

Here comes the evalution part :- after listeneing to the evaluators point of view it seems that they paid attention to each and every speech very precisely with minor details which we usually ignore , it was obvious that they have mastered this process of evaluation as it was very easy to understand our faults and some how that makes most of the sense.
I did not agree with the 3rd evaluator on the fact of adding more drama inside the meeting or while hosting ,because it shows the attitutde of gaining attention of audience forcefully, being normal is best.

At last test session was conducted, in this queston were asked form the speech of people in order to know how much someone was paying attention to meeeting and suprisingly every one was able to willing to answer every question which shows , how much they are attentive and they grasp things quickly .

The environment was friendly throught the meeting, each any every person was showing interest in the meeting by showing different gestures ,responses,etc.
Overall it was fun to know that these kind of activity also takes place ,as i have never thought of such kind of thing.
