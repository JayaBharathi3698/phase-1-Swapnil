The meeting was well organised by those group of people, some members were given specific tasks/roles to perform and monitor ,the performance of each individual speaker .

**Roles will be mentioned in other documentation**

This meeting majorly divided into three parts:-

i) Prepared speech session : in this speaker was supposed to speak and end his speech within 5-7 minutes.

ii) Table topic session : in this random topic was given to randon person and he/she is supposed to speak for about 1-2 minutes.

*additional event that was part of Table topic was Table turn code which was most interesting as in this ,speaker was supposed to speak on the topic for 2-3 min but the twist was when host show her hand then speaker was supposed to speak negative of which he/she was speaking.

iii) Evaluation session : Evaluators will evaluate and let the people know the positives, scopes of improvement, & some challenges within 2-3 minutes.

# At the meeting session :- 

At the beginning , the host intruduced to all the participants ,along with the role of each and every members which was way more different than those meetings that i have attended. The theme/topic of meeting was :- Life is a Pole of 50-50 chance, and slogan was :- shot in the dark meaning "a wild guess"
So our 1st speaker was none other than Ankit sir, it was quiet amazing to know more about his past days and the fact that he left his full time job and started teqaching as full time . 
The 2nd person was really good in expressing her self and using example of candle to demostrate the human state and using the molded wax of candle to make or convert it to a better product was remarkable. 
The thing that i liked about the 3rd person was that how she differentiated between teacher and a mentor, what a prodigy is and what a sutdent is.

Now moving towards table topic session , so our 1st topic was characteristics for which you would like to known for, the way that the person spoke without any preparation seems too professional
