The best part of the Steve Jobs movie was not the business learning or the insane success of Apple, but that the majority of the movie was focused on the failure of Apple and its ability to adapt and survive. There were some underlying themes that only real entrepreneurs would catch, because they understand it better than anyone else.

Learning from this movies are :- 
*  Steve Jobs wasn’t an icon; he was a necessity.
*  He didn’t code, he wasn’t an engineer, and he wasn’t a marketer.
*  He understood that emotions were a weakness.
*  He valued himself above all.
*  Even Apple took 20 years to become the powerhouse it is today.
