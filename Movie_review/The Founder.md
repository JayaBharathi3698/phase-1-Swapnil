Q-When you build you team to deliever fast service to the people , how  will you manage the team ,how will you bring like minded people?

A-Managing process is something that can not be done by every person, this skill is learned by experience. In order to make things fast and efficient we need to eliminate unnecessary movements,distractions and should have clearcut idea of what we are doing also, how we can get maximum output by working smartly with limited resources.
Being motivated and just focusing on the goal may lead every one to cooperate with everyone. Bringing like minded person in group is the most difficult task , but exploring new places , communicating well with others , reading their body language ,listening to their perspective how they think, these things might help to gather like minded people
